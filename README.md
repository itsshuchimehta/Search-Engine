# Search Engine Project

## Overview
**Duration:** September 2022 - December 2022  
**Role:** Backend Engineer  
**Tech Stack:** Python, BeautifulSoup

## Project Description
The Search Engine project involved the development of a custom search engine crafted in Python, focusing on indexing and ranking web pages. The project aimed to deliver a high-performance search system with an emphasis on accuracy and efficient data retrieval.

### Key Features and Responsibilities

- **Custom Trie Data Structure:** Developed a sophisticated Trie data structure for effective word indexing and retrieval. This included the implementation of frequency-based ranking algorithms and filtering mechanisms to exclude common stop words, enhancing search result relevance.

- **Advanced Web Crawling:** Employed state-of-the-art web crawling techniques for in-depth data extraction. This allowed the search engine to parse HTML content robustly, laying the groundwork for precise and comprehensive search results.

- **Search Accuracy Enhancement:** Focused on boosting the search accuracy by refining the web page ranking algorithms. This involved analyzing page content and metadata to rank pages based on their relevance to the search query.

- **Performance Optimization:** Worked on optimizing the overall performance of the search engine. This included streamlining the data indexing process and enhancing the speed of query responses, ensuring a smooth user experience.

## Learning Outcomes
Through this project, I gained extensive experience in backend development, particularly in the areas of data structures, web crawling, and search algorithms. The project honed my skills in Python and BeautifulSoup, and provided deep insights into the mechanics of search engine operation and optimization.
